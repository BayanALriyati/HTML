    <p>What is Lorem Ipsum?Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum <br/> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type <br/> and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into <br/> electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset <br/> sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker <br/> including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
